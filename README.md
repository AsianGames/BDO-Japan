#BDO-Japan [Update 10-19-2016]

* That is BDO-Japan?

BDO Japan is a project that involves the production of a English Patch, of the game **Black Desert Japan**.


* What is our goal?

Our goal is to keep constantly updated the patch as soon as possible after an client update, while a good translation quality will be priority and thus prevent it from being a lot of words that are not understood at all.


# INSTRUCTIONS

* Download our Zip File.
* Be sure to have your client closed.
* Unzip the Zip File.
* Copy the "prestringtable" folder in the "Blackdesert_live" directory of your client.
* Now run your client and enjoy it, translated into English.


# VALIDITY

* Valid from: 10/19/2016
* Expires on: 10/25/2016


# TIPS

* It is advisable not to update the client containing this patch. Before updating move / delete the "prestringtable" folder. In more than one year, no history of bans on the use of such patches, but it never hurts to be cautious.
* If after an upgrade, by running the client is not started or crash, delete the "prestringtable" folder, surely a patch upgrade is necessary, so you need to download it from our repository.


# DISCLAIMER

If you are satisfied with the work we do in the patch, please consider recognizing our efforts, buying us a beer. Thanks in advance.
